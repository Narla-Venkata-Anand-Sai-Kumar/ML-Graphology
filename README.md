# ML-Graphology

The "ML-Graphology" repository is dedicated to the exploration of machine learning techniques applied to graphology, the analysis of handwriting. This repository contains code, datasets, and resources for developing machine learning models to infer personality traits, emotions, or other characteristics from handwriting samples.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Narla-Venkata-Anand-Sai-Kumar/ML-Graphology.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ML-Graphology
   ```

3. Explore the code and datasets available to understand how machine learning algorithms can be applied to graphology.

## Features

- **Dataset:** Includes datasets of handwriting samples for training and testing machine learning models.
- **Models:** Contains implementations of machine learning models for graphological analysis.
- **Visualization:** Provides tools for visualizing handwriting samples and model predictions.
